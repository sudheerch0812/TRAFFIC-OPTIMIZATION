2.2	Components

The network design for the project incorporates the following devices:
For a network design focused on traffic optimization and reducing congestion in high-density networks, here's a breakdown of key components:

1. Routers and Switches: These form the backbone of the network, forwarding data between different segments. Efficient routing algorithms and fast switches are crucial to handle high traffic loads.

2. Load Balancers: They distribute traffic across multiple servers or paths to avoid overloading any single device. Load balancing is especially important in reducing congestion during high traffic periods.

3. Traffic Management Systems: These include techniques like:
   - Traffic Shaping: Managing data flows to ensure more critical traffic gets priority.
   - Quality of Service (QoS): Assigning different priority levels to different types of traffic (e.g., video streaming vs. general browsing) to prevent congestion from affecting high-priority services.

4. Multiple Paths/Redundancy: To avoid bottlenecks, networks should have multiple paths for traffic to flow. In case one path gets congested, data can reroute through an alternative path.

5. Congestion Management Tools:
   - Congestion Control Protocols: Protocols like TCP congestion control manage traffic flow to prevent packet loss and reduce delays.
   - Traffic Rerouting: Dynamic rerouting algorithms, like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), can help reroute traffic in case of congestion.

6. Monitoring Tools: Continuous monitoring of network performance to detect congestion before it becomes a problem. This might involve real-time traffic analysis and predictive modeling.

7. Network Topology Considerations: 
   - Mesh Topology: A mesh network helps in distributing traffic efficiently across different paths.
   - Hierarchical Topology: Helps in organizing traffic more efficiently, especially in large networks.

By combining these components, a network can better manage high-density traffic and reduce congestion.



2.3	IP Addressing Scheme

Here's how the IP addressing scheme fits into the topology to optimize traffic and reduce congestion:
1.	Core Network (Routers & Load Balancers)
o	IP Range: 10.0.0.0/24
o	Core Routers: 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2
o	Load Balancers: 10.0.0.3 to 10.0.0.4
o	Purpose: These IP addresses are assigned to the critical devices managing traffic between different subnets and ensuring load balancing and traffic routing.

2.	Redundant Links for High Availability
o	IP Range: 10.0.5.0/30
o	Router-to-Router Link: 10.0.5.1 and 10.0.5.2
o	Purpose: This subnet is used for the redundant links between core devices, allowing for automatic failover to maintain network availability and prevent congestion on single paths.

3.	Distribution Layer (Switches)
o	IP Range: 10.0.1.0/24
o	Switches: 10.0.1.1 to 10.0.1.10
o	Purpose: These switches aggregate traffic from the access layer, handle inter-VLAN routing, and can implement QoS to prioritize traffic efficiently.

4.	Access Layer (End Devices)
o	IP Range for Workstations: 10.1.0.0/24
o	IP Range for Servers: 10.2.0.0/24
o	Purpose: These subnets support workstations (10.1.0.x) and servers (10.2.0.x). Workstations typically have less time-sensitive traffic compared to servers, so they are placed in separate subnets for better management.

5.	VLAN Segmentation for Traffic Isolation
o	VLAN 10 (VoIP): 10.30.0.0/24
o	VLAN 20 (Servers): 10.20.0.0/24
o	VLAN 30 (Workstations): 10.40.0.0/24
o	Purpose: Different VLANs segment network traffic to prevent congestion. For example, VoIP traffic can be isolated in VLAN 10 to guarantee low latency, while workstations are isolated in VLAN 30
6.	Traffic Management Devices
o	IP Range: 10.100.0.0/24
o	Traffic Shapers & Monitoring Systems: 10.100.0.10 to 10.100.0.20
o	Purpose: This range is used for traffic management devices such as QoS systems and network monitoring tools, ensuring that traffic congestion is monitored and dynamically optimized.

7.	Management Network for Devices
o	IP Range: 10.10.0.0/24
o	Devices: 10.10.0.1 to 10.10.0.20
o	Purpose: Devices like switches, routers, and firewalls used for network management are placed in a separate management subnet for easy access and control.

8.	Public-Facing Services (if required)
o	Public IP Range: 203.0.113.0/24
o	Web Servers: 203.0.113.10, 203.0.113.20
o	Purpose: Public IP addresses are assigned to external-facing devices such as web servers, ensuring that traffic can be managed and optimized for inbound and outbound communication.

9.	Virtual IPs for Failover
o	VIP for Routers and Load Balancers: 10.255.0.1 (for redundant systems)
o	Purpose: Virtual IPs are used for high-availability scenarios, where the same IP is shared between redundant devices for seamless failover without affecting traffic flow.
